** Neural Networks **
An artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes that
that simulates the human brain

Perceptron algorithm  allowed an artificial neuron to simulate a biological neuron! The artificial neuron could take in an input, process it based on some rules, and fire a result.

Perceptron algorithm that would give rise to the incredibly mysterious world of Neural Networks — the artificial neuron could train itself based on its own results, and fire better results in the future. In other words, it could learn by trial and error, just like a biological neuron.

** More Neurons **

The Perceptron Algorithm used multiple artificial neurons, or perceptrons, for image recognition tasks and opened up a whole new way to solve computational problems.

 creating multiple layers of neurons — with one layer feeding its output to the next layer as input — could process a wide range of inputs, make complex decisions, and still produce meaningful results. With some tweaks, the algorithm became known as the ** Multilayer Perceptron **

 Neural networks are ridiculously good at generating results but also mysteriously complex; the apparent complexity of the decision-making process makes it difficult to say exactly how neural networks arrive at their superhuman level of accuracy.

** What is a Perceptron **

is a combination of two words:

* Perception (noun) the ability to sense something
* Neuron (noun) a nerve cell in the human brain that turns sensory input into meaningful information

perceptron is an artificial neuron that simulates the task of a biological neuron to solve problems through its own “sense” of the world.

Although the perceptron comes with its own artificial design and set of parameters, at its core, a single perceptron is trying to make a simple decision.
